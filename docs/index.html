            <h3>Full-Stack Development</h3>
            <p>I&rsquo;m proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - including ES6. I&rsquo;m familiar with a variety of libraries and frameworks, including React and Redux, and have worked with back-end technologies through Node and MongoDB, as well as PHP and MySQL. I integrate responsive, mobile-first design principles from the beginning of my workflow, and consider accessibility checks essential. I&rsquo;m constantly solving new problems and picking up new skillsets, and am eager to expand my coding horizons.</p>
            <h3>Web Design</h3>
            <p>As an artist, I understand that the visual experience of a website is just as important as its content and functionality. I&rsquo;m always looking for ways to make my websites works of art.</p>
            <h3>Fast, Self-Motivated Learner</h3>
            <p>I learned web development independently from the beginning, so I can quickly adapt to new situations and challenges and learn whatever skills necessary to solve a problem.</p>

                <p>I designed this website, my first full project, for a local church. Since my design was a complete re-do of their original website, I was tasked with coming up with a look that was visually pleasing as well as solving a variety of development challenges along the way.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">What I'm Learning Now</h2>
            <p>One of my favorite parts of web development is that there is always something new to learn. I&rsquo;m constantly looking into new topics and taking new classes to expand my skillset. At the moment, I am focused on mastering my skills in PHP and MySQL. My next big project is a custom CMS for writers, mimicking websites that allow users to submit their short stories online for others to view.</p>
            <p>I am passionate about accessibility and regularly look for ways to integrate accessibility testing into my workflow. I would like to research what disabilities might affect an individual&rsquo;s ability to browse the web comfortably, and how I can make websites to better serve them.</p>
