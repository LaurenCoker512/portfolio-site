            <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
            <p>I&rsquo;m proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - including ES6. I&rsquo;m familiar with a variety of libraries and frameworks, including jQuery and React. I integrate responsive, mobile-first design principles from the beginning of my workflow, and consider accessibility checks essential. I&rsquo;m constantly solving new problems and picking up new skillsets, and am eager to expand my coding horizons.</p>
            <p>I&rsquo;m also familiar with server-side and database concepts through Node and MongoDB, so can work comfortably with back-end developers on a project.</p>
            <h3>Web Design</h3>
            <p>As an artist, I understand that the visual experience of a website is just as important as its content and functionality. I&rsquo;m always looking for ways to make my websites works of art.</p>
            <h3>Fast, Self-Motivated Learner</h3>
            <p>I&rsquo;ve learned web development independently from the beginning, so I can quickly adapt to new situations and challenges and learn whatever skills necessary to solve a problem.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>I designed this website, my first full project, for a local church. Since my design was a complete re-do of their original website, I was tasked with coming up with a look that was visually pleasing as well as solving a variety of development challenges along the way.</p>

                <p>For this project, I challenged myself to clone a <a href="http://www.zoutula.com/themes/enfant-school/" target="_blank">paid WordPress theme</a>, so that I could both learn from professional design patterns and mimic development outcomes in different ways than in the original code.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">What I'm Learning Now</h2>
            <p>One of my favorite parts of web development is that there's always something new to learn. I&rsquo;m always looking into new topics and taking new classes to expand my skillset.</p>
            <p>At the moment, I am focused on learning back-end concepts, including server-side languages and databases. I&rsquo;m already very familiar with the Express framework for Node, and am currently diving into PHP, MySQL, and MongoDB. At the same time, I hope to expand my current knowledge of React and learn how to use Angular.</p>
            <p>I am passionate about accessibility and am looking for ways to integrate accessibility testing into my workflow. I also want to expand my Python skills and learn Ruby, as well as the Rails framework, for back-end development. </p>
