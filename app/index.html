            <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
            <p>I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - including ES6. I integrate responsive, mobile-first design principles from the beginning of my workflow, and consider accessibility checks essential. I'm constantly solving new problems and picking up new skillsets, and am eager to expand my coding horizons.</p>
            <h3>Web Design</h3>
            <p>As an artist, I understand that the visual experience of a website is just as important as its content and functionality. I'm always looking for ways to make my websites works of art.</p>
            <h3>Fast, Self-Motivated Learner</h3>
            <p>I've learned web development independently from the beginning, so I can quickly adapt to new situations and challenges and learn whatever skills necessary to solve a problem.</p>

                <p>I designed this website, my first full project, for a local church. Since my design was a complete re-do of their original website, I was tasked with coming up with a look that was visually pleasing as well as solving a variety of development challenges along the way.</p>

                <p>For this project, I challenged myself to clone a paid WordPress theme, so that I could both learn from professional design patterns and mimic development outcomes in different ways than in the original code.</p>
